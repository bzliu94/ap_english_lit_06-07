### Assignments

#### Kinds of assignments

In-class essays, out-of-class essays, handful of quizzes, four exams, timed in-class practice AP exams (sometimes involving not just essays but also possibly multiple-choice or short answer questions), in-class discussions, graded discussion question worksheets, preparatory worksheets, graded participation, assigned summer reading.

There were two poems per each of fourteen sections of Arp/Johnson.

Out-of-class essays were about assigned books and poems (but not short stories).

Four exams are two on BNW and P&P at beginning of semester one, a mythology test sometime in semester one, and a final (which includes an essay) at end of semester one. Rest of testing in form of in-class essays.

Bibliographies tended to not be used, but if one wants, a good style standard could be MLA.

About 12-15 in-class essays were assigned.

At most one out-of-class essay for each assigned non-textbook text and three to four out-of-class essays given covering poems.

No need to have taken AP Language before Ms. Minor's AP Literature class. One other teacher for AP Literature for same academic year was Mr. Duncan. For some later academic years, there was also a teacher for AP Literature who joined named Mr. Hardin.

Blogs for AP Literature at Westview for different academic years are available on the internet s.t. they can help as supplements assuming one is missing the in-person discussion aspect of an AP Literature class.

There were likely six to seven short stories assigned.

There was approximately one essay of any kind every two weeks.

Essays (of any kind) touch on theme, setting, structure, character, use of literary devices, language and meaning.

Some poems were taken from the back of Arp/Johnson.

A guess is that there were 8-9 out-of-class essays (including those on poetry).

Out-of-class essays assigned can each be revised for a higher grade.

The Importance of Being Earnest was assigned reading for late in the course and had no assigned out-of-class essay for it.

### Translation recommendations

Pevear/Volokhonsky for Crime and Punishment.

### Teacher notes

Ms. Minor began teaching at Westview HS in 1997 and began teaching AP Literature at Westview in around 2005. She retired after end of academic year 2008-2009.

When she began teaching AP Literature, she took over from another teacher and initially was the sole teacher of AP Literature at Westview. Later, Mr. Duncan and Mr. Hardin joined in as demand for the class grew.

Mr. Duncan joined Ms. Minor in teaching AP Literature in between 2005 and 2006 and did teach the class for academic year 2006-2007. He left Westview in 2015 and had by then taught AP Literature for six years. We don't know if there were gaps or if he had taught some years significantly before 2005 or 2006. Assuming there were no gaps, he would have stopped teaching AP Literature in around 2011 or 2012. It seems that he began teaching at Westview in around 2001.

Mr. Hardin joined Ms. Minor possibly for academic year 2007-2008. We know he likely did not teach the class at Westview for academic year 2006-2007. He likely left Westview in around 2012 (e.g. after academic year 2011-2012). It seems possible he was teaching AP Literature for each year beginning in around 2007 until he left in around 2012. We do not know if there were gaps or if he had taught some years significantly before around 2007. It seems he began teaching at Westview at around 2007.

It seems Ms. Minor tended to handle up to three sections of AP Literature on top of sections for other classes for each academic year. For as long as she was still teaching at Westview, it seems to be the case that the other two teachers who joined in before her retirement tended to handle around two sections of AP Literature at most (on top of sections for other classes).

Almost certainly there have been other teachers who have begun teaching AP Literature at Westview in the intervening years, but we do not mention them.
